Generic computer vision datasets, composed of images scraped unceremoniously from sites like Flickr, are most useful for general object recognition, training algorithms to distinguish a raven from a writing desk (or, at any rate, “bird” from “furniture”). But what species of raven is it? Answering that question requires access to images broken into much narrower, more precise categories.",

We see the list as a living resource and invite readers to make suggestions and contributions. We hope this reading list might serve as a useful resource for scholars and practitioners investigating ML datasets as sociotechnical assemblages that shape and are shaped by social worlds.",
