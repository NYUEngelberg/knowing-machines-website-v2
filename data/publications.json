          "excerpt": "This project traces how media systems are using, interpreting, and anticipating Generative AI to create public life. We’re studying how the news industry frames Generative AI, when and why journalists are using it in their work, which policies and guidelines organizations are creating to regulate its use, and how people and infrastructures have the power to make Generative AI a public problem. Through dataset tracings, studies of metajournalistic discourse, policy analysis, critiques of news language, investigations of critical incidents in Generative AI journalism, and interviews with journalists, legal counsels, and product officers, we are building an image of how journalism—as a field, a profession, and sociotechnical practice—is shaping, anticipating, and responding to synthetic media, creating new ways of understanding press freedom, the power of journalistic language, and sociotechnical constructions of public interest.",

Joler and Crawford contextualize the current explosion of artificial intelligence by asking how we got here — and to consider where we might be going. Multiple works of critical cartography span the two floors, and invite visitors to experience the longue durée of how technology and power have been intertwined since 1500. ",

Yet there has been very little research that has focused on dataset creators or listened to what they have to say. In this project, we speak with 18 different dataset creators in a series of interviews that reveal the messy and contingent realities of dataset preparation. We hear about their practices and the shared challenges they face. We offer a set of actionable recommendations that would improve the practice of dataset creation while also building a more responsible AI ecosystem.",

Projects at the intersection of nature observation, citizen science, and machine learning offer useful case studies for examining systems of dataset production, model training and human feedback. They also present an alternative model to the extractive and exploitative “Big Data” approach to training machine learning algorithms, offering many possibilities as well as unique challenges for thinking through how we relate to AI systems.
