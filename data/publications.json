Generic computer vision datasets, composed of images scraped unceremoniously from sites like Flickr, are most useful for general object recognition, training algorithms to distinguish a raven from a writing desk (or, at any rate, “bird” from “furniture”). But what species of raven is it? Answering that question requires access to images broken into much narrower, more precise categories.",

You could be a researcher who stumbled upon your university’s archive of handwritten census cards from 1939. Or a designer creating a chatbot that relies on large language models like GPT-3. Perhaps you’re an artist experimenting with visual style combinations using DALLE-2. Or maybe you’re an activist with an urgent story that needs telling, and you’re searching for the right dataset to tell it.",

The list is organised into various sections to help readers follow their specific interests and is primarily focused on academic publications. This list is also not meant to be exhaustive. We see the list as a living resource and invite readers to make suggestions and contributions. We hope this reading list might serve as a useful resource for scholars and practitioners investigating ML datasets as sociotechnical assemblages that shape and are shaped by social worlds.",
