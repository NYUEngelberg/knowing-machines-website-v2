Fiction writers and the Authors Guild that own registered copyrights brought a suit against OpenAI for copyright infringement for copying their works to train ChatGPT. The Guild’s complaint extensively discussed the threat and harm that generative AI like GPT-N and ChatGPT pose to authors and their livelihoods. The plaintiffs called attention to ChatGPT readily offering to produce summaries of copyrighted works, which they allege are derivative works. The plaintiffs laid out how ChatGPT was able to produce accurate summaries or hypothetical volumes of each of the plaintiffs’ existing work to allege that ChatGPT could not have generated the material if it had not ingested and trained on the specific works.
