Plaintiffs Michael Chabon, David Henry Hwang, and Matthew Klam are authors with many registered copyrighted works. In their proposed class action complaint to both OpenAI and Meta, they alleged copyright infringement on the basis that OpenAI and Meta used copyrighted materials to train the GPT model and the LLaMa model rendering the models themselves and ChatGPT and LLaMa unauthorized derivative works of the training material. The complaint also outlined DMCA violation for removal of copyright management information, violation of the California unfair competition law, negligence, and unjust enrichment.

In August 2023, plaintiffs in Tremblay v. OpenAI, who made indistinguishable claims against OpenAI as those made in Chabon v. OpenAI, moved to relate the two cases.
