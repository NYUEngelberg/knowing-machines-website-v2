Authors with registered copyrighted works brought a proposed class action complaint to OpenAI, alleging copyright infringement on the basis that OpenAI used copyrighted materials to train the GPT model rendering the models themselves unauthorized derivative works of the training material. The complaint also outlined DMCA violation for removal of copyright management information, violation of the California unfair competition law, negligence, and unjust enrichment.

In August 2023, plaintiffs in [Tremblay v. OpenAI](https://knowingmachines.org/knowing-legal-machines/legal-explainer/cases/tremblay-v-openai), who made indistinguishable claims against OpenAI as those made in Chabon v. OpenAI, moved to relate the two cases.
