The comedian and author Sarah Silverman and other published authors claimed that Meta infringed upon their copyright by making copies of their books as part of training data for LLaMA as well as works of those who are similarly situated. The complaint was filed along with the one filed against OpenAI by the same lead plaintiffs. In the dismissal motion, Meta has argued that using the published text to train LLaMA to statistically model language and generate original expression is transformative by nature and quintessential fair use, likening it to Google's copying of books to create an internet search tool, which was found to be fair use.
