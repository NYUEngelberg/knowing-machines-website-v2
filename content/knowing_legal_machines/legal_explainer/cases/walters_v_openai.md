In *Walters v. OpenAI*, the radio talk show host Mark Walters sued OpenAI for defamation after he found out that when a journalist prompted ChatGPT for information about an unrelated lawsuit, the tool falsely described Walters as a defendant in the case who had been accused of fraud.  Walters is seeking monetary compensation from the companies for the alleged reputational damage that their tools caused.

OpenAI is going out of its way to avoid the conclusion that its output should be considered a “fact,” [point]ing to](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.gand.318259/gov.uscourts.gand.318259.12.1.pdf) its disclaimers about ChatGPT’s lack of reliability and suggesting that since its outputs are “probabilistic,” they can never really be considered factual statements.

OpenAI is also arguing that it fails to meet defamation’s publication requirement.  OpenAI is basically arguing that ChatGPT is the Word document. The company refers to its [Terms of Use](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use)—which assign users rights to their ChatGPT outputs and states that users are “responsible” for them—to describe ChatGPT as nothing more than “a private drafting tool” that “helps [a user] write or create content owned by the user.” This is a novel argument, but one that the courts will likely reject, at least when it comes to publicly available tools like ChatGPT and Bing. Defamation law has traditionally [recognized](https://www.journaloffreespeechlaw.org/hendersonhashimotolemley.pdf) that publication “encompasses any communication of the idea to a third party other than the plaintiff [and defendant] themselves,” no matter who “owns” the communication. When a company operating a GenAI tool shares an output with the individual user who prompted the tool, it’s publishing that output to someone other than itself.
