Getty Images brought claims against Stability AI for copyright infringement, DMCA violation, and trademark infringement and dilution. Getty Images alleged that Stability AI used more than 12 million Getty Images photos to train the model for Stability’s image generator, Stable Diffusion. In the complaint, Getty Images juxtaposed a copyrighted Getty Images photograph next to an image generated by Stable Diffusion to underscore the link between the two. The generated images included in the complaint have what Getty Images calls a modified version of the Getty Images watermark, which Getty Images claims to have harmed it by “creating confusion as to the source of the images and falsely implying an association with Getty Images."
