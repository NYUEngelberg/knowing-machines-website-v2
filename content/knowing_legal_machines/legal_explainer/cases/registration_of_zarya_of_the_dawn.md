Kristina Kashtanova applied for copyright registration of a graphic novel work, “Zarya of the Dawn,” which was created with output from Midjourney that Kashtanova described as “the core creative input” for each image. Registration certificate was granted but the USCO canceled the registration due to a failure to exclude non-human authorship contained in the work. The USCO then replaced it with a new registration that covers the original authorship of Kashtanova, narrowing its coverage to the “text” and the “selection, coordination, and arrangement of text created by the author and artwork generated by artificial intelligence.”
