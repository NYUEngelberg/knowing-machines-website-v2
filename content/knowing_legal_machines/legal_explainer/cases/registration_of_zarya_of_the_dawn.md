Mr. Jason Allen applied for copyright registration of a two-dimensional artwork claim in the work titled “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial,” which was generated using Midjourney after employing as many as 600 text prompts. The USCO requested more information about Allen’s use of Midjourney and subsequently denied the registration. When Allen submitted requests for reconsideration, USCO review board found that the work contained more than a de minimis amount of AI-generated content which must be disclaimed in an application for registration. The USCO refused to register the work, because Allen was unwilling to disclaim the AI-generated material.
