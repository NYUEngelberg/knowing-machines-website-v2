Battle v. Microsoft involves an Air Force veteran, Jeffrey Battle, who happens to share the same name as a member of the “Portland Seven,” a group of U.S. citizens who tried to join the Taliban in Afghanistan after 9/11. Battle sued Microsoft for defamation after he discovered that searching his name on Bing, the GenAI-assisted search engine, generated a short blurb that conflated the bios of the two Jeffrey Battles.

Battle is seeking monetary compensation from the companies for the alleged reputational damage that their tools caused. He is also explicitly asking for a “remedy that will ensure that the damaging activities . . . cease and desist and that the false information will be . . . removed” from Bing search results “in perpetuity.” Microsoft has not yet responded to Battle’s complaint.
