In *Andersen v. Stability AI*, three named visual artists filed a proposed class action suit against Midjourney, Stability AI and DeviantArt, whose generative AI models were allegedly trained on billions of images scraped from the Internet without the permission of the copyright holder. The complaint alleged that there was direct and vicarious copyright infringement through non-consensual use of their works through works generated “in the style” of the artists. The complaint further claimed violations of the DMCA, violations of the right of publicity law, Cal. Civ. Code § 3344, violations of the common law right of publicity, unfair competition, and breach of contract of DeviantArt’s privacy policies.

During a hearing in July 2023, U.S. District Judge William Orrick of Northern District of California indicated that he was inclined to dismiss most of the claims and allowed the plaintiffs to file a new complaint. Judge Orrick also remarked that the plaintiffs should more clearly differentiate their claims against each defendant.
