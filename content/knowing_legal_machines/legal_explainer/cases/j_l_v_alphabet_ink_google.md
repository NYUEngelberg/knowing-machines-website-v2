The plaintiffs, led by a New York Times best-selling author and journalist, J.L, who requested to keep their identity private, filed a putative class action complaint against Alphabet, Google Deepmind and Google LLC. The case alleges that Google misused content that the plaintiffs posted on social media and Google platforms, to train Bard. They alleged copyright infringement, DMCA violation, and other torts. In September, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed Alphabet and Google Deepmind, leaving Google LLC as the sole defendant.
