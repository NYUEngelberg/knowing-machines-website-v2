Writer Julian Sancton brought claims of copyright infringement and contributory copyright infringement against OpenAI and Microsoft on behalf of a putative class of owners of nonfiction works. The plaintiffs alleged that reproducing copyrighted works in datasets used to train their AI models constituted direct copyright infringement. Plaintiffs moved to relate the case to [Authors Guild v. OpenAI](https://knowingmachines.org/knowing-legal-machines/legal-explainer/cases/authors-guild-v-openai), another class action brought by authors.
