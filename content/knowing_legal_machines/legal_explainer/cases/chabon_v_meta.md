Plaintiffs Michael Chabon, David Henry Hwang, and Matthew Klam are authors with registered copyrighted works. In their proposed class action complaint to Meta, the authors alleged copyright infringement on the basis that Meta used copyrighted materials to train the LLaMa model and the models themselves are unauthorized derivative works of the copyrighted training material. The complaint also outlined DMCA violation for removal of copyright management information, violation of the California unfair competition law, negligence, and unjust enrichment.

In November 2023, Northern District of California Judge Chhabria did not find plausible theories in Chabon’s claims and granted Meta’s joint motion to dismiss against Chabon for lack of plausible theory of infringement as in [Kadrey v. Meta](https://knowingmachines.org/knowing-legal-machines/legal-explainer/cases/kadrey-v-meta).
