Generative AI raises a host of legal questions and concerns.  Some of these questions will challenge existing legal rules and require new laws and policy frameworks. Others have answers that are quite well settled, notwithstanding the new AI context that bringsis bringing attention to them.

It can often be hard for non-experts to distinguish between these two types of questions.  The legal profession’s affinity towards “it depends” or “on one hand, on the other hand” answers exacerbates this problem.  

This explainer is an evolving project to provide everyone with the types of answers that legal experts might informally provide to each other.  They start with a short answer to help you understand the most likely answer in the most likely cases. That answer is then given a confidence score on a scale of 1-5, where 1 is “it really is anyone’s guess,” and 5 is “there are decades of case law to support this answer.” 

In many cases, the question/answer pairs also include some of the cases that are actively litigating them. These cases may serve as examples of how a dispute over the question can work in real life.  They are also cases to keepthat might be worth keeping an eye on if you are especially interested in the question.

Finally, there is a longer answer to the question. Those longer answers explain the various factors that went into forming the short answer, and how changes to those factors could impact it.  They should help you get a better understanding of the legal context around the question and the answer.

While we hope that these questions and answers will help you understand the shape of the legal discussions around generative AI, you should not use them as legal advice.  One reason lawyers tend towards “it depends”-type answers is because it really does depend. Even answers that are right in most cases will be influenced by specific facts and details that we do not touch on here. If you want a specific legal answer about a specific action, you should still talk to a lawyer.
