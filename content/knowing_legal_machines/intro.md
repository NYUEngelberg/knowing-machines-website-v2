Many of the social questions raised by artificial intelligence are mediated through the legal system. Policymakers explore new rules to govern the technology, courts work to apply existing legal framework to new situations, and advocates propose entirely new approaches to deal with novel problems (or old problems with new prominence).

The legal work of the Knowing Machines Project strives to inform these processes with cutting-edge research and insights, especially in terms of the ways that AI systems are trained and the data used to do so. As part of these efforts, we file comments with administrative agencies trying to understand how their mandates are impacted by artificial intelligence, submit amicus briefs to bring information and context to courts navigating disputes, and propose new approaches for structuring society’s interaction with the technology. 

These debates are evolving quickly.  Today, we invite you to use these resources to understand the current state of the discussion. We cover topics from how Clearview AI’s facial recognition system unlawfully trains on our faces to AI companies using dangerous free speech arguments to the future of FOIA in the Age of AI to ways regulators can help workers resist employer surveillance to the potential deceptiveness and unfairness of emotion recognition technologies. In the future, we hope that they will serve as a snapshot of our understanding of them in 2023.
