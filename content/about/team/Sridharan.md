**Hamsini Sridharan** is a 2nd year PhD student at Annenberg. She studies historical and contemporary entanglements of digital technologies with environmental imaginaries and speculative futures, asking how such entanglements shape the critique, contestation, and governance of technology. She holds an MPA from the USC Price School of Public Policy, where she focused on digital media policy, as well as an MA in Anthropology from Columbia University, where she explored the sociocultural underpinnings of conservation genetics. Her undergraduate degree is in Anthropology and International Studies from the University of Chicago. Prior to joining the doctoral program at Annenberg, she was the program director for MapLight, a nonprofit organization, where she advanced policy efforts related to campaign finance reform and digital disinformation through research and analysis, coalition building, and public communication.
