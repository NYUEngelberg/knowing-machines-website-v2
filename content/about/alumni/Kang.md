**Edward (Byungkwon) Kang** is a PhD candidate at USC's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. His research concerns the social dimensions of machine learning technologies and the cultures in which they are embedded, with a specific focus on the intersection of sound, identity, and data. In the context of his dissertation, he explores the sociotechnical imaginaries around voice and listening that undergird the operational logics of contemporary voice identification/biometric and analysis systems. His writing has been published in Social Studies of Science, New Media & Society, and the International Journal of Communication. He has previously served as a committee member for Annenberg's annual Communication and Cultural Studies graduate student conference Critical Mediations, led Music Production workshops for Annenberg's Critical Media Project with California Humanities, and worked as assistant editor for the International Journal of Communication. In his personal life, he is semi-active as a music producer, sound engineer, and DJ.
