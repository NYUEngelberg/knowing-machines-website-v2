This project traces how media systems are using, interpreting, and anticipating Generative AI to create public life. We’re studying how the news industry frames Generative AI, when and why journalists are using it in their work, which policies and guidelines organizations are creating to regulate its use, and how people and infrastructures have the power to make Generative AI a public problem. Through dataset tracings, studies of metajournalistic discourse, policy analysis, critiques of news language, investigations of critical incidents in Generative AI journalism, and interviews with journalists, legal counsels, and product officers, we are building an image of how journalism—as a field, a profession, and sociotechnical practice—is shaping, anticipating, and responding to synthetic media, creating new ways of understanding press freedom, the power of journalistic language, and sociotechnical constructions of public interest.
